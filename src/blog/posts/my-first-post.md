LinkedIn’s Social Selling Index (SSI) is an automated score that measures an individual’s social selling activities. The score ranges from 0-100 and takes into account factors such as profile strength, engagement with content, brand building, and profile recommendations.

While this is somewhat useful information to know when you're just starting out at social selling, there are some big drawbacks to be aware of:

LinkedIn doesn't know how to help you improve your actual sales results
LinkedIn only gives you very vague information about how to improve your SSI
The SSI is not something I regularly use as a successful social seller, because it doesn't actually measure my business success from using LinkedIn
As a result, sellers should be aware that the SSI score exists, and may want to check it every so often in the early days of building their LinkedIn account.

However, there are far better ways to improve and track your social selling performance than trying to improve your SSI.

## What Does Social Selling Actually Mean?

As someone who has sourced and closed over $4M+ in revenue from social selling, I like think of Social Selling as "Helping People Publicly".

Put another way: it's the practice of using social media to connect with both your buyers - and others in your buying ecosystem! - and engage them in conversation. That way, you'll attract more prospects (as well as partners and job candidates) into your pipeline. Social selling involves publishing targeted content to demonstrate your credibility, engaging influencers and prospects publicly, and leveraging the trust you've built to generate leads and sales.

## What makes up the LinkedIn SSI?

The LinkedIn Social Selling Index (SSI) is a score created by LinkedIn to measure your success in social selling. The score is based on four key components: building a professional brand, engaging with insights, finding the right people, and building relationships. Each of these components is measured separately. The higher your SSI score, the better your social selling skills are perceived to be by LinkedIn.

### 1. Establish your professional brand

By commenting on relevant posts, and sharing your own content at least weekly, your score will increase. This will make it easier for prospective clients and partners to find you and get an idea of who you are and what you stand for. Additionally, with a higher score, your profile will be more visible when searched on the network which can help you to stand out from the crowd. But again, this is simply a measurement of personal brand awareness, not a measure of your actual reputation, which is not something LinkedIn can quantify.

### 2. Find the right people

If your LinkedIn SSI Score is low, it means you may need to Connect with more people that are in your industry on LinkedIn. By analyzing users’ connections, engagement rates, and other criteria, the score helps to identify users who have strong networks and are likely to be influential within them.

### 3. Engage with insights

Engaging with insights is one of the main tenets of social selling, in my view. This portion of your SSI score gives you a better understanding of how your content resonates with your audience, helping you to understand if your posts are generally effective and targeted. Commenting on influencers' posts can help you to gain exposure to new audiences and get valuable feedback on your content.

### 4. Build relationships

This aspect of the score looks at your engagement within Direct Message channels with your network (meaning, you converse with others and they reply - spamming people who then block you, will not accomplish this, of course).

Now, the important question...

## Is the LinkedIn SSI Actually Important?

Not really, no. Like any leading indicator, the LinkedIn SSI score is a general gauge of whether you're active on LinkedIn in the ways that matter, as I've described above. So it's only important to separate yourself into tiers: if you're in less than the top 50% of your industry, you have some work to do. If you're in the top 5-10%, you're getting there. If you're in the top 1%, you're doing the right kind of activities.

But when we talk about whether this metric is important, we shouldn't confuse "doing activities" with "successful at growing your career and business".

## What Should You Do Instead To Increase Sales on LinkedIn?

Focus on getting engagement on your content - both Posts and Comments - with other relevant people within your target account base.
When posting content, your key goals should be to Demonstrate Credibility and Highlight Customer Results. If you don't do this, it doesn't matter how much engagement you get in total, because it won't lead to new business.
That said: do shoot for an Engagement Rate on your Posts of at least 1.5% (defined as the number of unique engagers on your post, divided by the number of Views).
Have direct message (DM)conversations with people that are on the buying committee within your target accounts, meaning your prospective decision-makers and their teams. DMing with your peers, influencers, competitors, and friends is fine - but again, you need to be targeted in your approach.
The difference between focusing on your LinkedIn SSI, and focusing on improving your social selling results, can be summed up like this:

The LinkedIn SSI measures activity, but it does not measure targeted activity that leads to building pipeline and closing sales.  

For that reason, it's not very valuable other than as a novelty and to get a high-level general idea of where you stand.

## LinkedIn SSI FAQs

### Is the LinkedIn SSI important?

Yes and no. It's a decent snapshot of your activity at a high level, but it doesn't tell you whether that activity is well-targeted to help you sell more.

### How do you find your LinkedIn SSI score?

### What is a good social selling index score on LinkedIn?

60-80, or otherwise being in the Top 2% of your industry and network.

### How do I increase my SSI?

Post relevant native content to your LinkedIn feed without linking to third-party blogs; engage publicly with other people in your customer base, and have active direct-message conversations with them too.

### What Impact Does LinkedIn SSI Ranking Have?

None. It's a vanity metric. Hypothetically, f you were closing millions of dollars with an SSI Score of 50, you'd be much better off than closing barely anything with a score of 90.

### Can Other LinkedIn Members View Your Social Selling Index Score?

No, not unless you share it with them :)

### Is "sales" equivalent to "social selling" in this day and age?

No. Social selling involves using social media to demonstrate your credibility and highlight your customers' results, in addition to taking prospects through a traditional sales process. Sales professionals don't need to use social media - but it does give them an advantage.

### How Often is LinkedIn SSI Updated?

Monthly.

### Do salespeople with a higher SSI score outperform sales reps with a lower SSI score?

According to LinkedIn's research:

* Social selling leaders create 45% more opportunities than peers with lower SSI.
* Social selling leaders are 51% more likely to reach quota.
* 78% of social sellers outsell peers who don’t use social media.

Personally? I absolutely agree that a seller who understands social media has a huge advantage.

But, here's a big caveat: LinkedIn's research is limited to Sales Navigator users. And remember, that's not a complete dataset! Think about it: there are plenty of sellers in industries that don't use LinkedIn much, or who established their reputation in enterprise sales long before LinkedIn was popular, who barely do social selling and still close eight figures worth of business every year.

That said, I advise that you take every advantage you can get, including learning the fundamentals of social selling.
